TalkerNode is a [Talker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talker) base, written in
Node.js .

The latest version of TalkerNode can always be found at
https://github.com/marado/TalkerNode .

## Installation

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/marado/TalkerNode
> yarn # or `npm install`
```

Then, you run the talker by doing:
```bash
> node TallkerNode.js
```

That will make your talker run on the default port (8888), but you can
make it run on a different port by setting up the environment variable PORT:

```bash
> PORT=3333 node TallkerNode.js
```

Now that your talker is running, feel free to connect to it! The first user
created will be of the highest rank. You can connect to your own talker, either
by pointing your favorite MU* client to localhost in port 8888, or, for
instance, using telnet:

```bash
> telnet 0 8888
```

Enjoy!
